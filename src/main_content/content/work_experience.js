                SEL has been a great learning experience. One of my favorite
                aspect of SEL's culture is their values. I believe that their
                focus on taking ownership and focusing on their customers has
                helped me become a better engineer. I look forward to learn more
                lessons and improve my overall knowledge as my career
                progresses.

                frontend technology. Beyond that Fenway group has provided me
